# Bank ops plan

_In attendance: Daisy, Max_

_Aside: pardon the puns in this doc. On the Hack Club Bank team, an “Onboarding” call is a call between a new user and the ops team to get set up on the platform._

We want to avoid pitfalls of WHW that took a long time:

	- onboarding calls
	- esp onboarding calls in other timezones
	- international payments (things that weren’t purchased on cards)

We think we have a solution:
	- Make onboarding group calls offered twice weekly just while onboard is started (and we expect an influx of grants)
	- Make onboarding calls optional
		- accounts don’t need contracts because they aren’t raising money
		- we’ll make a screen recording of ordering on JLCPCB using HCB cards
	- Restricting orders to just a manufacturer that supports our cards means that orders should work in any country that the manufacturer supports.
		- We can skip the long lead-times from PayPal and wire transfers

Actionables:

- Record purchase of boards on JLCPCB via HCB card for bank team to link to in signup
- Setup flow for group onboarding calls that people opt-into
