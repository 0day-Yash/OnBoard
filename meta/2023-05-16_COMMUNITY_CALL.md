# Community Call

_In attendance: Maggie, John, Max (2 seperate meetings)_

We want to run this call even in the hypothetical that our donor (Tom) isn’t confirmed because we still want the recording to use for the launch

Call flow:

> I give about five minutes of context of why making PCBs,  is so fun… And introduced the whole idea of the onboard program
> I then pass it over to you and you do a very quick walk-through of building up your card. Design in EadyEda .
> we ask people to put whatever questions they have in the chat, because will be recording
- John

we’re announcing the call in #community and this channel. The call is about PCB design and creation— the call to action is “show up and learn about making X in easyEDA”. We aren’t on the hook to have people signing up for onboard because it won’t be launched by then. This will be recorded and we can use the recording (after edits) as a material for the launch.
