# OnBoard Team Sync 2023-05-19

_In attendance: Al, Daisy, John, Kognize, Kevin, Max, Zach_

## Updates:

- John
  - Hack Clubber reached out (@CAPSLOCK) and hadn’t heard about this project–we should market this more in the Slack
  - Got feedback from IEEE contact that it’s going to take a while and don’t give the impression that they’ve missed the chance to help fund this
  - Heard back from Macetech and they’re excited to help but aren’t sponsoring. We'll need to find a way for them to engage
- Zach
  - Tom is in to donate & also wants to make a PCB himself– we should figure out how to have him involved
  - Talked to Chris Rake and they’re interested in making a PCB-based teaser for next year’s kickoff puzzle
  - Looked into shipping options and found a cheap way to send out a mailer campaign
  - PCBWay is up for sponsoring a print run of some marketing material we can send to people
- Kevin
  - Researching automated design checking, but now that we’re using EasyEDA and Gerber upload, he’s researching a PR checklist
  - New approach is just a screenshot of their order on JLCPCB (low tech)
  - Demo’d a github flow for submitting via submodule
- Daisy
  - Current working flow for bank
    - Based on winter hardware wonderland
    - Group onboarding calls
    - Need to chat with Kevin to figure out transition from github approval -> bank onboarding
- Lexi
  - Website is being worked on rn (Max is working on copy pass for Monday)
  - [Figma with in-progress designs](https://www.figma.com/file/Yja7uS1E8iDhD2vRP6vNgf/Onboard-design-exploration?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=PrDAzbTfNaVeEvLo-1)

## TODO:

- Research marketing PCB board (Max will post in #onboard– hopefully Hugo responds)
- Send out another blast on the Hack Club Slack (Max will ask Maggie to post more)

## Open questions:

- What if a project goes over $100? Can we start on demo-only accounts and upgrade to contracts? Results should loop in Zach to talk to lawyer about.
- Kevin: do we submit via PR like winter hardware wonderland or try to make something with submodules work? Emphasis on user experience while submitting?
- How do we approach this marketing via shipping a PCB board idea?
