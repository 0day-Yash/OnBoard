# Onboard Project Scope

## Team & Responsibilities

Max: Product Manager
John: Creative Lead
Kevin: Hacker Experience
Al: Operations Support
Daisy: Operations Support

## Goals

1,000 teenagers in USA build their first PCB within 1 year of launch

New teenagers are brought into Hack Club, lots of teenagers are pushed technically and get very inspired around electronics design, follow-on projects are created by teenagers after their initial PRs because they are so inspired, we partner with cool people who have teenager communities (Styropyro) to spread the word and get them involved.

In 1 year we look back, the above goals are hit, and turn OnBoard into an ongoing fund to give every teenager $100 toward PCB making. Lots of donors are excited to fund it as an evergreen project. It’s a social contract like libraries for young people!

## Roles (to be assigned)

- This is how we market this, get the word out
- Beautiful marketing page
- This is how you sign up and get your PCB submitted
- Training / inspiration: how to guides on how to design specific PCB boards, and how to get them manufactured by JLCPCB
- Money ops flow. How do we give grants to people? What is the SOP?
- Financing the project. Need to raise $150,000!

## Project scope:

- Marketing:
  - https://hackclub.com/onboard/ inspiring marketing site with VERY CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS
  - Beautiful 8.5x11” poster for mailing
  - Marketing PCB board instructions about the program and QR code (NFC anyone?)
  - Instructional video on how to make a PCB published on FreeCodeCamp YouTube
  - CS teachers mailing campaign
  - GitHub newsletter
  - FIRST blog post + Chief Delphi w/ Dean Kamen endorsements
  - New partnerships (IEEE, etc)
- Product:
  - https://github.com/hackclub/onboard with super approachable instructions in README on what the project is + how to submit and get the funds. Also good documentation on the money ops flow.
    - Clear guidelines on what can be approved/rejected
      - Has to be a unique design in some capacity
      - Can be at any level of complexity
      - Everybody should be using a specific software because then we could easily check if everything looks right. Ex. EagleCAD can check if there are no glaring errors.
