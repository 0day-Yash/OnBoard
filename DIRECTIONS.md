# Directions
Interested in submitting to OnBoard? You're in the right place!

## 1. Fork!
- [ ] Fork of this repo [`onboard`](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard/)! This is the where you'll add your project and eventually PR from.
- [ ] Fork [`Onboard-template`](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard-template/) and give it a name! This will be your project repo to store design files.

## 2. Design a Board!
It's design time! Head over to an eCAD software of your choice (EasyEDA, KiCAD, Eagle) and start designing!

Never designed before? No problem! We have design resources for EasyEDA, a free online eCAD program. Check them out here.

## 3. Upload to JLCPCB and Check
- [ ] Upload your Gerber files to JLCPCB and make sure they pass inspection. 

This is **VITAL** since your project will only be approved if it passes inspection. Take a screen shot. You'll include this in your PR later.

## 4. Add Your Design to Your Project Repo
- [ ] Add your design files (schematics, PCB, and Gerbers) to the project repo you made earlier!
We've structured `OnBoard-template` into `src` and `gerber`. Place your schematic and PCB files into `src`. Place your gerber  into `gerber`.
