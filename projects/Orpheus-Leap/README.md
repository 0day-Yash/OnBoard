# Orpheus Leap

## Summary
##### Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do?
The Leap was a board I designed during to congratulate everyone in Summer of Making! It's a Arduino Leonardo in the shape of our lord and savior, Orpheus! We made 500 of them and shipped them to makers around the world!

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost? What's your timeline?
The Leap costed ~$6 per board. I made it during the Summer of 2020 üèñÔ∏è.

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design philosophy. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional**
I wanted the Leap to be a beautiful sendoff for Summer of Making. It's components follow the natural contours of Orpheus. She's also fully functional, able ot act as a USB device (the pros of using an Arduino Leonardo).

The board shape was defined in Adobe Illustrator, cleaned up in Fusion 360, and routed in Eagle. If you have questions about making wacky shaped boards, hit me up on slack `@Kevin Yang`.
